## Deployment

### Git Commands
After writing the code on Gitpod, I used the Git Commands:

* git add and file or directory name, adds files to the staging area for Git.
* git commit -m "message", record the changes made to the files to a local repository.
* git push, sends local commits to the remote repository on GitHub. 


### GitHub Pages
The deployment was deployed to the GitHub pages.
From my GitHub web page, I open the repository I want to deploy, in this case, “Username-projectname”. 
Then at the top right of the page click on the 'Settings' link, and scroll down to the GitHub Pages section, 
I selected the master branch as source, click on save, and I was provided with the following 
message: Your site is published at (project URL)/


### Forking the GitHub Repository

Once you locate the repository you want to fork, at the top right of the page below the right items in the navigation bar the fork button can be located.
Now you should have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone
*important not forget github repository
You find step by step to how to clone a repository from GitHub to your computer on [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) Cloning a repository from GitHub.
